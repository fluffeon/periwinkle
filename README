readme wip

credit to Barrucadu, i've used some of his code https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=78311
also to ChatGPT, i had to use it at times
To be transparent: Some of the code is AI generated, but that shouldn't take away from it's quality and purpose really.
This will be good to analize later on to make independent Bash programs, I'm still learning and this will be good to learn from.

I'm only putting it on the internet because maybe there's people that will find this useful.
